The summary tables show: id, name of trial, epoques, the learning rate, the batch and chunk size, 
    _ 4 maps with the significance of the error per cell for the years that are not included in training (2012,2014,2016,2018)
        calculated as e = Di(Di+Fi)/SDi  where Di=ground truth, Fi= projection, SDi= sum of ground truth
    _ the loss diagram, where orange = train and blue = test
    _ a line diagram of the sum population comparing ground truth and projection
    _ cell value error %, calculated by the reclassification of the significance of error
